          <blockquote>
            <p>“After start up, we realized the audit is very conservative – it’s not a sales number followed by a lesser reality. The audit number was 10-12 percent under our actual collections. You have to appreciate that you can trust the process and understand your numbers will be accurate or even a little better.”</p>
