          <h4>Practice Management</h4>
          <p>Physicians feel overloaded with the business side, and end up taking time away from patients. Likewise, office managers typically serve as practice administrator, secretary, scheduler, report generator and operations manager for the practice.</p>
          <p style="color: #fd9215;">Finance, Performance, and Risk</p>
          <p>Each client firm has their own set of Finance, Performance, and Risk pages. The categorization of reporting into pages, allows group leadership, flexibility and flow of information.</p>
          <p>The Performance page offers a myriad of group or individual provider non-fiscal analytics. Specifically, current month E&M volumes, RVUs, and group averages. As well as, month to month group/individual performance trending. Each page houses a template of reports with room for custom reports.</p>
