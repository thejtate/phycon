          <h4>Coding & Compliance</h4>
          <p>Let us keep you up-to-date with ever-changing rules and billing requirements.
            PhyCon coding services are accurate, efficient, and affordable. We employ quality certified medical coders and consistently train insuring all coders are up to date on recent rules and requirements. We conduct random audits and quality assurance assessments to maintain at least a 98% accuracy rating. </p>
          <p style="color: #fd9215;">Physician Documentation and Training Feedback</p>
          <p>PhyCon prides itself on continuous communication with our clients.  Part of this constant communication is in the form of Provider Documentation and Training.  We will meet with every member of your group prior to contract implementation to discuss the every changing rules and requirements relating to documentation.  PhyCon also meets with every provider in every group at least annually to re-train group members and meet with those providers that are new to the group.  Finally, for those providers who require it, PhyCon will conduct monthly training sessions to ensure that every member of your group is documenting appropriately.</p>
